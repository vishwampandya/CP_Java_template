###To Do  
1)obviously , make this readme file  
2)Give sample input for all templates and proper comment it (all the types of inputs...)  
3)set input as var for all templates (specifically buffer reader one)</br>  
4)do something for default values if - no arguments passed , first passed but isnumber and vice versa , number out of range etc  
5)add comments all over.  
6)make a makefile for which will do all the initial setup
###For read me  
1)added a templates_path variable for temporary and file execution  
2)add proper steps to set home dierectory path

    Add export PATH="your-dir:$PATH" to the last line of the file, where your-dir is the directory you want to add.
